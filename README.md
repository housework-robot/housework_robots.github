# Anatomy of Housework Robots


# Objectives

Here is a set of repositories, containing 3 kinds of contents, 

1. Documents: 
   
   Step-by-step guidances to clone housework robots including Stanford mobile aloha and others.

   The documents are organized into seasons, and each season consists of multiple episodes. 


2. Source codes:

   Every season has a source code repository.

   Aligned with the guidances, the repositories contain the related source codes. 

   Some source codes are modified based on the original source codes like Stanford mobile aloha open source. 

   Other source codes are created by our team, usually aimed to improve the performance of the robot. 

3. Videos:

   The content of the videos are video records of the robot movement, controlled by the source codes in the repositories. 

   Usually every season's every episode has one video with 2 versions. The English version is hosted in Youtube.com, and the Chinese version is hosted in Bilibili.com
