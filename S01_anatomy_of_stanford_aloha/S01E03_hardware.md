# Interbotix physical arm
SO1E03, 2024.03.16

# 1. Objective


[Stanford mobile aloha housework robot](https://github.com/MarkFzp/mobile-aloha?tab=readme-ov-file#hardware-installation) uses 2 pairs of robotic arms.
In last episode, we worked with the [rviz2](https://github.com/ros2/rviz) simulation, and this time, we used the physical interbotix robotic arms, which were shipped to our lab a few days ago. 

First we used one interbotix arm, to execute a series of actions. Then we used two arms to move simultaneously. The purpose was to learn the usage of interbotix robotic arms, but not yet the action learning algorithms. Therefore, in both scenarios, the series of actions were hard-coded in our python programs. 


# 2. Preparation

Step 1. We took an Interbotix vx300 robotic arm out of the box, and connected it to a computer USB port. We used a linux desktop with GPU, [Lamdba Tensorbook](https://lambdalabs.com/deep-learning/laptops/tensorbook/specs).

Step 2. Following the suggestion of [Stanford aloha project](https://github.com/MarkFzp/mobile-aloha?tab=readme-ov-file#hardware-installation), downloaded and installed [dynamixel wizard](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/dynamixel/dynamixel_wizard2/).


# 3. Single arm manipulation

Step 1. Detect the USB port

Open the dynamixel wizard, go into "options" page, and configure the options as following. 

   ~~~
   Protocal 2.0
   All ports
   1000000 bps
   ID range from 0-10
   ~~~

After then, hit "Scan" button, the dynamixel wizard detects that the Interbotix vx300 robotic arm was connected to a USB port, e.g. USB0 port.

Step 2. Change the configurations

Double-check whether the modes.yaml and vx300.yaml are configured with the right port, e.g. ttyUSB0. You can refer to [the src of this repo](https://github.com/housework-robot/main/tree/main/S01_anatomy_of_stanford_aloha/src/interbotix_ros_manipulators/interbotix_ros_xsarms/interbotix_xsarm_control/config) for the functional settings. 

~~~
$ gedit /home/robot/interbotix_ws/install/interbotix_xsarm_control/share/interbotix_xsarm_control/config/vx300.yaml

"""
# Set the port to USB0, by adding the following content to the first line. 
port: /dev/ttyUSB0
"""


$ gedit /home/robot/interbotix_ws/install/interbotix_xsarm_control/share/interbotix_xsarm_control/config/modes.yaml

"""
# Remove the port setting, which usually appeared in the first line of the file.
"""

Step 3.  Launch the xsarm_control node

Open a terminal, execute the following commands,

~~~

Now the Interbotix physical vx300 arm should start moving. It is recommended to have someone hold the robotic arm with their hands, and be careful not to get injured by the robotic arm.

# 4. Dual arms manipulation

Now we challenge ourselves with two robotic arms moving simultaneously. 

Step 1. Detect the USB port

Following the same instruction of " 3. Single arm manipulation -> Step 1 "ï¼Œ we found that in our scenario, the ws250 arm used USB0, and the vx300 arm used USB2 to connect the laptop Lambda Tensorbook. 


Step 2. Change the configurations

Double-check whether the modes_1.yaml and modes_2.yaml are configured with the right ports, e.g. ttyUSB0 for the first arm wx250, ttyUSB2 for the second arm vx300. You can refer to [the src of this repo](https://github.com/housework-robot/main/tree/main/S01_anatomy_of_stanford_aloha/src/interbotix_ros_manipulators/interbotix_ros_xsarms/examples/interbotix_xsarm_dual/config) for the functional settings. 

~~~
$ gedit /home/robot/interbotix_ws/src/interbotix_ros_manipulators/interbotix_ros_xsarms/examples/interbotix_xsarm_dual/config/modes_1.yaml

# Set the port to USB0, by adding the following content to the first line. 
port: /dev/ttyUSB0


$ gedit /home/robot/interbotix_ws/src/interbotix_ros_manipulators/interbotix_ros_xsarms/examples/interbotix_xsarm_dual/config/modes_2.yaml

# Set the port to USB0, by adding the following content to the first line. 
port: /dev/ttyUSB2
~~~


Step 3.  Launch the xsarm_dual node

Open the first terminal, execute the following commands,
   
~~~
$ ros2 launch  interbotix_xsarm_dual xsarm_dual.launch.py robot_model_1:=wx250 robot_name_1:=arm_1 robot_model_2:=vx300 robot_name_2:=arm_2 use_dual_rviz:=true
~~~

It should automatically open the rviz simulator.

Step 4. Run a series of predefined actions

Modify the xsarm_dual.py code, if needed, take a look of [the src of this repo](https://github.com/housework-robot/main/blob/main/S01_anatomy_of_stanford_aloha/src/interbotix_ros_manipulators/interbotix_ros_xsarms/examples/interbotix_xsarm_dual/demos/xsarm_dual.py) for reference. 


Open another terminal, execute the following command, 

~~~
$ cd ~/interbotix_ws/src/interbotix_ros_manipulators/interbotix_ros_xsarms/examples/interbotix_xsarm_dual/demos/

$ gedit xsarm_dual.py 
"""
...
def main():
    # robot_1 is the "node owner", meaning that it controls the state of rclpy.
    robot_1 = InterbotixManipulatorXS(
        robot_model='wx250',
        robot_name='arm_1',
        moving_time=MOVING_TIME_S,
        node_owner=True,
    )

    # Because robot_1 is the node owner, we set this one's node_owner arg to False.
    robot_2 = InterbotixManipulatorXS(
        robot_model='vx300',
        robot_name='arm_2',
        moving_time=MOVING_TIME_S,
        node_owner=False,
    )

# 5. Trouble shooting.

If you do not follow the steps above, you might encounter the following error.
<img src="./image/physical_arm_20240315_8.jpeg">

At this point, you can refer to the instructions in "``3. Testing the control of the Interbotix arm``" and follow them, then run the corresponding command.
