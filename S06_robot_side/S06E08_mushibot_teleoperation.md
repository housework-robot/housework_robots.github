# Anatomy of Mushibot's Teleoperation

## 1. Objectives

In this blog, we will discuss and implement teleoperation for Mushibot, a wheel-legged robot. The teleoperation consists of the following steps, 

     1.1 We connect a ubuntu computer to a wifi, and get a local IP address.  
     
     1.2 We construct a http website in the ubuntu computer, using [express js](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html). 


     2.1 When the mushibot executes `setup()`, it connects to the same wifi network, and gets a local IP address, too.
