# Anatomy of the Motion Control of Mushibot

## 1. Objectives

In [the previous blog](./S06E04_anatomy_wheel_legged_mushibot.md), we studied how to wire the motors, servos, sensors and IMU modules together, 
to construct a wheel-legged robot, [Mushibot](https://github.com/MuShibo/Micro-Wheeled_leg-Robot), 
which is almost a mini version of ETH Zurich's Ascento, 
with some differences in the shape and structure of the leg linkages etc.
