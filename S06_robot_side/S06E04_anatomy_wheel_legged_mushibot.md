# Anatomy of Mushibot, Another Wheel-legged Robot

# 1. Objectives

In the last article, we studied [Stack-force's wheel-legged robot](https://gitee.com/StackForce/bipedal_wheeled_robot). 
What boards, modules, and chips are used, how are they wired together, and how to write program to access them.

In this article, we studied another wheel-legged robot, [Mushibot](https://github.com/MuShibo/Micro-Wheeled_leg-Robot), 
which is almost a mini version of ETH Zurich's [Ascento](https://www.ascento.ai/), with some differences in the shape and structure of the leg linkages etc. 

In addition to the anatomy of its hardware, we spent more time on Mushibot's motion control.
